# Java JDK 21: Making Java Cool Again for Beginners

Hello, Java enthusiasts! Buckle up because we're about to embark on a thrilling journey through the latest features of Java JDK 21. If you're a beginner, you're in for a treat. If you're a seasoned Java developer, well, you're also in for a treat. Basically, everyone gets a treat. It's like Halloween, but for Java developers.

## The Main Event

Java JDK 21 is rolling out the red carpet for a new feature that's set to revolutionize the way beginners learn Java. It's called "Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods". Yes, it's a mouthful, but don't let the name intimidate you. It's like the friendly giant of Java features - big name, but a total softie at heart.

This feature is all about making Java more accessible to beginners. It's like the cool teacher who lets you call them by their first name and makes learning fun. The goal is to let students write their first programs without having to grapple with the big, scary language features designed for large programs. It's like learning to swim in the shallow end before diving into the deep end.

## The Goals

The goals of this feature are simple:

1. **Smooth On-Ramp**: It's like a gentle slope into the world of Java, letting educators introduce programming concepts in a gradual, digestible manner. No more throwing beginners into the deep end and hoping they can swim.

2. **Growth**: It helps students write basic programs in a concise manner and grow their code gracefully as their skills grow. It's like a coding bonsai tree.

3. **Reduced Ceremony**: It cuts down on the pomp and circumstance of writing simple programs. No more dressing up in a tuxedo to write a script or a command-line utility.

4. **No Separate Dialect**: It doesn't introduce a separate beginner's dialect of Java or a separate beginners' toolchain. It's all Java, all the time.

## The Changes

The feature introduces changes to the protocol by which Java programs are launched to allow instance main methods. These methods are not static, need not be public, and need not have a `String[]` parameter. It's like the dress code at a casual Friday office - come as you are.

For example, the classic "Hello, World!" program can be simplified to:

```java
class HelloWorld { 
 void main() { 
  System.out.println("Hello, World!");
 }
}
```

It's like the "Hello, World!" program went on a diet and lost all the extra weight.

Furthermore, the feature introduces unnamed classes to make the class declaration implicit:

```java
void main() {
 System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```
It's like the "Hello, World!" program went from a diet to full-on minimalist lifestyle.

## The Preview
This feature is in preview in JDK 21, which means it's not fully standardized and could change in future versions. It's like a sneak peek of a movie - you get a taste of the action, but the final cut might be different.

To try the examples in JDK 21, you must enable preview features when compiling and running the program. It's like getting a backstage pass to a rock concert - you need the special pass to get the full experience.

So there you have it, folks! Java JDK 21 is making Java cool again for beginners. It's like the Java version of a hipster coffee shop - it's all about making things simple, accessible, and a little bit quirky. So grab your favorite cup of java (see what I did there?) and dive into the world of JDK 21. Happy coding!
