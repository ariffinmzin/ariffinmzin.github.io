3. This is where you can input or adjust your HTML code. Be sure to save the changes once you're finished.

## Step 5: Leveraging ChatGPT for HTML Generation

ChatGPT can assist you in generating HTML structure for your website. Here's a simplified prompt to generate a basic HTML layout which incorporates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap:

>Take on the persona of an experienced web developer.

>Generate a portfolio website utilizing HTML, CSS media queries, JavaScript, and Bootstrap Cards. The CSS and JavaScript must be embedded inside the HTML file.

>The website should be responsive across devices, look corporate and elegant. It will show my picture in a blue coloured header from a file named me.jpg with the size of 120px width and 150px height. The picture should be inside a circle and the half of my picture will be located outside of the header using the :after pseudo element. The website has grey coloured background underneath the Bootstrap card. It also has copyright letter inside the footer. The writing must be formal and straightforward, using center alignment and written inside Bootstrap Cards according to its category. The writing uses different font styling like bold, underline and italic. The website will include CDN logo for Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok links using the below HTML code.

```html
<a href="https://cdnlogo.com/logo/facebook-square-icon_429.html"><img src="https://www.cdnlogo.com/logos/f/74/facebook.svg"></a>
<a href="https://cdnlogo.com/logo/linkedin-icon_39423.html"><img src="https://www.cdnlogo.com/logos/l/66/linkedin-icon.svg"></a>
<a href="https://cdnlogo.com/logo/twitter_40255.html"><img src="https://www.cdnlogo.com/logos/t/45/twitter.svg"></a>

<a href="https://cdnlogo.com/logo/tiktok_550.html"><img src="https://www.cdnlogo.com/logos/t/60/tiktok.svg"></a>
```

>Each CDN logo must use the following CSS setting: 

>width: 30px

>height: 30px

>margin: 0 10px

>Below are my LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter links that need to be  associated with the CDN logo provided above. Use target="_blank"

>Facebook link: https://www.facebook.com/

>Twitter link: https://twitter.com/
